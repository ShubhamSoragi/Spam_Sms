# Spam SMS Prediction

This project focuses on detecting spam messages using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using a predictive model.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming for text normalization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes methods such as Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
- **Model Building**: Implements machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamSoragi/Spam_Sms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Spam_Sms
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset by placing it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.
3. Train the model using the training script.
4. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script.
